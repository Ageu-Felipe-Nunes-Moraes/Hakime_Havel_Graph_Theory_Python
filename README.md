# Hakime Havel

The **Hakime Havel** code is a Python implementation of an algorithm to check if a given vector can be graphically represented, following the principles of the Hakime Havel concept.

## Implementation Details

- The algorithm iterates through the vector, reducing the values of its elements according to certain rules.
- If the resulting vector meets the criteria of a graphical vector, it is considered as such, and a message is displayed.
- Otherwise, the vector is considered non-graphical.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python code.
2. Call the `hakime.graphic_vector()` function, passing a vector as an argument to check if it is a graphical vector.
